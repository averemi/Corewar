    Breakdown of the project’s objectives
This project is broken down into three distinctive parts:

    The assembler 
This is the program that compiles the champions and translates
them from the assembly language into “Bytecode”. Bytecode
is a machine code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual
machine.

    The virtual machine 
It’s the “arena” in which the champions are executed.
It offers various functions, all of which are useful for the battle of the champions.
The virtual machine allows for numerous simultaneous processes.

    The champion 
The champion provided here scares the bejesus out of a
neurasthenic hedgehog!
